**You are Carol Danvers. You were the woman on that black 
box risking her life to do the right thing. My best friend. 
Who supported me as a mother and a pilot when no one else 
did. You were smart, and funny, and a huge pain in the ass. 
And you were the most powerful person I knew, way before 
you could shoot fire through your fists.**

*-Maria Rambeau*

This quote from Maria offers even proof of all the ways 
that Carol Danvers is the hero we need. Not only will she 
throw herself on the fire when necessary, but she’ll also step
 up in all of the smaller ways that can mean even more to people
 who count on you. Even when there’s a lot less glory to be had.



**Captain Marvel possesses self-healing/regeneration powers, fires energy blast on her Enemies has cosmic awareness as Doctor Strange and could work in an unbeatable binary mode.** She came to work with Avengers in defeating Thanos. Her confidence in her intense and unbeatable powers were shown when she told Avengers that she is going to kill Thanos alone and they were defeated before because she wasn't with them. Her valour and glory brought an adrenaline rushin everyone's body when she fights with thanos on her own for the first time, Thanos was seen bit weakened. It would have been impossible for the Mad Titan to snap his fingers again if he would not have used power stones to Punch her. When everyone thought that she would not come back. Captain Marvel sustained the effect of the power stone and returned with no harm.

Thanos, the mad Titan just snapped his fingers at the battle in wakanda after getting all the six Infinity stones. Half of the world's population including many of a people of Superheroes like Spider-Man, Doctor Strange, Black Panther and many more returning into access right in front of our wet eyes. Nick Fury is travelling in his car with his assistant in Nwe York while he is seeing the catastrophic coming. Everyone is expecting something from him when he immediately takes his Pager and sends a signal to someone while he too is turning to ashes. Now the only hope to the of the universe is that unknown receiver at the other end!!!

As it turned out to be, that receiver was none other than Captain Marvel. To our surprise, she was the **First Avenger** who was till now believed to be Captain America, Captain Marvel originally named Carol Danvers was an officer in US Air Force and she got her powers from an explosion in which the cosmic energy released from the explosion got fused with the DNA. Out of this was born the biggest superhero of all times **Captain Marvel**. Her powers were acknowledged by the world when she single-handedley save the world from Ronan as shown in the movie. This gave hope to humanity that Captain Marvel will ultimately save everyone in Avengers Endgame.

As as long as Captain Marvel is there patrolling in the outer space and saving the planets against the aliens, we can sleep in our homes without any fear. The Saviour is alive and will always be!!!
