## CAPTAIN MARVEL
###‘**You are Carol Danvers. You were the woman on that black 
box risking her life to do the right thing. My best friend. 
Who supported me as a mother and a pilot when no one else 
did. You were smart, and funny, and a huge pain in the ass. 
And you were the most powerful person I knew, way before 
you could shoot fire through your fists.’**

*-Maria Rambeau*

This quote from Maria offers even more proof of all the ways 
that Carol Danvers is the hero we need. Not only will she 
throw herself on the fire when necessary, but she’ll also step
 up in all of the smaller ways that can mean even more to people
 who count on you. Even when there’s a lot less glory to be had.
